This repository contains the files necessary to run a python quiz with 05 questions.
I used OOP programming concepts to train my skills.

## Setup
You need to install Python 3.11. You can do this by following the steps on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/). 

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open quizGame folder
3. Run the main.py file with Python IDE.

Or you can download the four .py files and upload then on [Online Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/).
Make sure to run the `main.py` file. The quiz will run on the terminal window below.
